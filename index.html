    I have been a factory worker for nearly 9 years. When the Crona-Virus hit I
    thought It was time to change career paths or start on a proper career paths
    more like. I got started on my path by my mentor who introduced me to a site
    called Udemy, coding, and investing, along with some factory skills. Now I
    plan on becoming a full stack Web Developer. My end goal is to be able to
    competently program anything from websites to games to AI. I know I have a
    long road ahead of me, but you know what they say, "A journey of a thousand
    miles begins with a single step".

  <h3>Education and courses(currently taking)</h3>
  <p>I've only graduated highschool, and I,ve never been to college. Though I am
    currently taking a course with coursera for an IT certificate. I plan on
    using that to help me break into the tech industry. Of course if that doesn't
    go my way then I will go to a community college to get a tech degree.
    However this all assumes that I'll have a knack for "IT" in the first place.
